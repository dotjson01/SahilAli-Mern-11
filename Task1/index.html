HTML forms, defined using the <form> Tags are essential for collecting user input on web pages. 
They incorporate a variety of interactive controls such as text fields, numeric inputs, 
email fields, password fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons. 
Over 85% of websites rely on forms to gather data from users, making them a 
fundamental component of modern web development.
